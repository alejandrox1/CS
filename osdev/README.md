# Operating Systems

This repo is an ongoing project trying to encapsulate all important aspects 
related to os dev.

* [simpleos](simpleos/) shows the entire source code for the various sections of 
  [Writing a simple operating system - from scratch](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf).

* [jmos](jmos/) Kernel development [tutorial series](http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/).


The goal of this project is to serve as a full guide, as such, more detailed
explanations and theory are included [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JtrxBbQX-pWulECyfn2ViafW5vUefNyb2Op8IdYVkW8/edit?usp=sharing).


# Resources
* [os-tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial) is also based on
  [Writing a simple operating system - from scratch](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf).
  A lot of the code included in our version of [simpleos](simpleos/) was taken
  from here.
